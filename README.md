### Listening skills

As noted by Bolton (1986).

#### Attending

* Postsure of involvement
* Appropriate body motion
* Eye contact
* Nondistracting environment

#### Following

* Door openers
* Minimal encouragers

#### Reflecting

* Paraphrasing
* Reflecting feelings
* Reflecting meanings (tie feelings to context)
* Summative reflection

### Assertion skills

As noted by Bolton (1986).

* Submission-Assertion-Aggression continuum
* Assertion messages: non-judgemental description of behavior - disclosure of feelings - tangible effect on the asserter
* Six-step assertion process: 1) preparation, 2) sending messages, 3) silence, 4) reflective listening to other's response, 5) recycling steps 2-4 as often as needed, 6) focus on solution
* Other assertive options: natural assertions, self-disclosure, descriptive recognition, relationship assertions, selective inattention, temporary withdrawal, permanent withdrawal, spectrum response, natural and logical consequences, stop the action: accept the feelings, say no, 

### Conflict resolution skills

As noted by Bolton (1986).

* Conflict is an opportunity
* Conflict prevention and control: reflective listening, assertion skills, awareness of triggers, social arrangements, non-defensiveness
* Handling emotions: focus on emotions first, treat the other with respect, listen until you experience the other side, state your views feelings and needs
* Preparation: timing is right for both sides, agreed-upon rules of engagement, best location

### Collaborative problem-solving skills

As noted by Bolton (1986).

* Types of conflicts: regarding emotions, regarding values, regarding needs
* Alternatives to collaborative problem-solving: denial, avoidance, capitulation, domination
* Collaborative problem solving steps: 1) define the problem in terms of needs not solutions, 2) brainstorm possible solutions, 3) select solutions that will meet both parties' needs, 4) detailed plan of action (who, what, where, when), 5) implement the plan, 6) evaluate the process and the solution
* Problem-solving preliminaries: deal with strong emotions, set time and place for problem-solving, involve correct people
* Avoid common traps: not handling emotions first, not defining problem properly, evaluating or clarifying during brainstorming, not working out nitty-gritty details, not following up on planned actions, not finding hidden agendas, repeat the process when needed
* Applications of the problem-solving process: goal setting, as part of a helping relationship, 

### Skill selection

As noted by Bolton (1986).

* Skills alone are insufficient. Essential attitudes: genuineness, non-posessive love, empathy
* Aspects of genuineness: self-awareness, self-acceptance, self-expression
* Aspects of love: acceptance, respect, empathy
* Effect change: commit to using skills, select appropriate situations, persist despite occasional failure, prepare others for the change

## Difficult Conversations

Difficult conversations take place when there are strong emotions, opposing opinions, or high stakes involved (Grenny et. al, 2022; Patterson et. al., 2013). Skills for difficult conversations are organized around a conversation planner (Grenny et. al, 2022; Patterson et. al., 2013).

* Who are you speaking with? What is the topic?
