## Basic Skill Clusters

As noted by Bolton (1986).

* Listening skills
* Assertion skills
* Conflict resolution skills
* Collaborative problem-solving skills
* Skill selection

### Listening skills

As noted by Bolton (1986).

#### Attending

* Postsure of involvement
* Appropriate body motion
* Eye contact
* Nondistracting environment

#### Following

* Door openers
* Minimal encouragers
* Infrequent questions
* Attentive silence
* Watch body language: words used, sound of voice, rapidity of speech, facial expression, posture, gestures, clothing, grooming, environment, discrepancies, your own feelings and reactions

#### Reflecting

* Paraphrasing
* Reflecting feelings
* Reflecting meanings (tie feelings to context)
* Summative reflection

### Assertion skills

As noted by Bolton (1986).

* Submission-Assertion-Aggression continuum
* Assertion messages: non-judgemental description of behavior - disclosure of feelings - tangible effect on the asserter
* Six-step assertion process: 1) preparation, 2) sending messages, 3) silence, 4) reflective listening to other's response, 5) recycling steps 2-4 as often as needed, 6) focus on solution
* Other assertive options: natural assertions, self-disclosure, descriptive recognition, relationship assertions, selective inattention, temporary withdrawal, permanent withdrawal, spectrum response, natural and logical consequences, stop the action: accept the feelings, say no, 

### Conflict resolution skills

As noted by Bolton (1986).

* Conflict is an opportunity
* Conflict prevention and control: reflective listening, assertion skills, awareness of triggers, social arrangements, non-defensiveness
* Handling emotions: focus on emotions first, treat the other with respect, listen until you experience the other side, state your views feelings and needs
* Preparation: timing is right for both sides, agreed-upon rules of engagement, best location

### Collaborative problem-solving skills

As noted by Bolton (1986).

* Types of conflicts: regarding emotions, regarding values, regarding needs
* Alternatives to collaborative problem-solving: denial, avoidance, capitulation, domination
* Collaborative problem solving steps: 1) define the problem in terms of needs not solutions, 2) brainstorm possible solutions, 3) select solutions that will meet both parties' needs, 4) detailed plan of action (who, what, where, when), 5) implement the plan, 6) evaluate the process and the solution
* Problem-solving preliminaries: deal with strong emotions, set time and place for problem-solving, involve correct people
* Avoid common traps: not handling emotions first, not defining problem properly, evaluating or clarifying during brainstorming, not working out nitty-gritty details, not following up on planned actions, not finding hidden agendas, repeat the process when needed
* Applications of the problem-solving process: goal setting, as part of a helping relationship, 

### Skill selection

As noted by Bolton (1986).

* Skills alone are insufficient. Essential attitudes: genuineness, non-posessive love, empathy
* Aspects of genuineness: self-awareness, self-acceptance, self-expression
* Aspects of love: acceptance, respect, empathy
* Effect change: commit to using skills, select appropriate situations, persist despite occasional failure, prepare others for the change

## Difficult Conversations

Difficult conversations take place when there are strong emotions, opposing opinions, or high stakes involved (Grenny et. al, 2022; Patterson et. al., 2013). Misunderstandings get resolved sooner in healthy relationships compared to unhealthy ones (Grenny et. al., 2022). Skills for difficult conversations are organized around a conversation planner (Grenny et. al, 2022; Patterson et. al., 2013). I attended a Crucial Conversations training. The steps to plan a crucial conversation were presented in a different order than what they appear in the book. I'll list the steps in the order presented in the training, but I'll list the relevant book chapter under each section for easy reference.

### Get Unstuck

See Crucial Conversations 3rd Edition chapter 3.

* Who are you speaking with? What is the topic?

```


```

* Decide if you should focus on content, pattern, or relationship.
  * Content is usually a single specific event.
  * Pattern is usually things that happen repeatedly.
  * Relationship issues start to impact trust and respect.

```


```

* Condense your concern down to a single sentence.

```


```

### Master My Stories

See Crucial Conversations 3rd Edition chapter 5.

* What stories are you telling yourself about the situation or person? (victim, villain, helpless)

```


```

* Challenge negative stories by filling in with more analysis.
  * What is my role?
 

```


```

  * Why would a reasonable person do this?

```


```

  * What should I do right now to move toward what I want?

```


```

### Start with Heart

See Crucial Conversations 3rd Edition chapter 4.

Make sure you have proper intent.

* What do I want for myself?


```


```

* What do I want for the other person?


```


```

* What do I want for the relationship?


```


```

* What do I want for the organization?


```


```

* How can you share your good intent at the start of the conversation?

```


```

### STATE My Path

See Crucial Conversations 3rd Edition chapter 8.

* Share your facts
* Tell your story
* Ask for others' paths
* Talk tentatively
* Encourage testing

### Make It Safe

* Think about how the other person might misunderstand your intent. What is a contrasting statement you could use?

```


```



### Learn to Look

See Crucial Conversations 3rd Edition chapter 6.

* How will you manage your style under stress (silence, verbal violence, both) in this conversation?

```


```



### Seek Mutual Purpose

See Crucial Conversations 3rd Edition chapter 7.

* In what ways are you at odds with the other person? What is your purpose? What do you think their purpose is? How could you seek mutual purpose?

```


```



### Explore Others' Paths

See Crucial Conversations 3rd Edition chapter 9.

* How can you use AMPP (ask, mirror, paraphrase, prime) to help the other person join you in a discussion?

```


```

* What feedback does the other person have? How can you use ABC (agree, build, compare)?

```


```



### Move to Action

See Crucial Conversations 3rd Edition chapter 11.

* Who:

```


```

```


```

* By when:

```


```

* How will you follow up?

```


```

## Addressing Performance Gaps

The steps to have a conversation about unmet expectations are similar to the steps to have a crucial conversation with some substitutions most of the way through the process. I'll like to the crucial conversation steps mentioned above where they match and then add the additional steps in this section.
